            <h3>What is mypowerisout.org?</h3>
            <p><a href="http://www.mypowerisout.org">Mypowerisout.org</a> is a website for people to report a power outage and get real-time information and advice.  It has been optimized for mobile devices.  We are also building Apple and Android apps to make the service even easier to use.</p>
            
            <h3>How can utility companies use this website?</h3>
            	<P>Utility companies can use the dashboard to create location-specific alerts that are immediately viewable by all users in that location (e.g. <em>Update for Cambridge, MA: Crews are in your area; we expect to have power restored in 2 hours</em>).  Utility companies also have real-time access to the data, including a map of reported outages and outage statistics.  We are actively building other tools/capabilities and we welcome your feedback/suggestions. </P>

            <h3>How can utility companies benefit from using this website?</h3>
			<P>As you know, communicating with customers during power outages is challenging and expensive.  By using this website, utility companies can reduce call volume (cost) and improve customer satisfaction.</P>
            
            <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
          	<p>Nothing.  We built this as a service to the community. </p>
            
            <h3>How can I learn more?</h3>
            <p>Please send us an <a href="mailto:webmaster@mypowerisout.net">email</a> and we will respond as soon as possible.</p>
            
            <h3>How can my company sign up?</h3>
            <p> You can sign up <a href="contact.html">here</a>.  After we verify your identity you will receive a secure password with which to access your dashboard.</p>
